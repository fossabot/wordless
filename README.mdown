Wordless is an opinionated WordPress plugin that dramatically speeds up and enhances your custom themes creation. Some of its features are:

* A structured, organized and clean [theme organization](https://github.com/welaika/wordless/tree/master/wordless/theme_builder/vanilla_theme)
* Bootstrap a new theme directly within wp-cli
* Write PHP templates with [Pug templating system](https://github.com/pug-php/pug)
* Write CSS stylesheets using the awesome [Sass syntax](http://sass-lang.com)
* Write Javascript logic in [Coffeescript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/)
* A growing set of handy and documented PHP helper functions ready to be used within your views
* Development workflow backed by [WebPack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [BrowserSync](https://www.browsersync.io/) (with live reload), [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/), [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/). All the standards you already know, all the customizations you may need.

## Getting started

**Prerequisites**

1. Install WP-CLI http://wp-cli.org/#installing
2. Install global packages from NPM: `npm install -g foreman yarn`

Once done, considered you have a standard Wordpress installation already up and running and you are in its root directory:

1. `wp plugin install wordless`
2. `wp plugin activate wordless`
3. `wp wordless theme create mybrandnewtheme`
4. `cd wp-content/themes/mybrandnewtheme`
5. `yarn install`

Now you have all you need to start developing üíª; just be sure to be in your theme directory and run

`yarn run server`

webpack, php server and your browser will automatically come up and serve your needs :)

## GiT and Deployment

Wordless 2.x is backed by *WebPack* for all code automation tasks (compiling, but it's up to you to eventually extend it to other behaviours - image optimization will probably be v2.1 goal). As a general advice on a default Wordless installation you should add `screen.css` and `application.js` your `.gitignore`.

Those compiled assets **must** obviously **be deployed** on remote server.

PUG templates are compiled by the WP plugin at runtime and cached in theme's `tmp` folder. So just gitignore tmp/* and no other worries.

As a result we provide a minimal `.gitignore` inside theme's folder:

```git
tmp/
!tmp/README.mdown
application.js
screen.css
node_modules
```

## Additional recommended plugins and tools

Wordless is not meant to be a bloated, all-included tool. This is why we recommend adding some other plugins to get the most out of your beautiful WP developer life.

<img src="http://welaika.github.com/wordless-extender/assets/images/wordless-extender.png" align="right" style="max-width: 100%" />

* We are developing [Wordless-extender](https://github.com/welaika/wordless-extender). A little plugin, that brings our collection of favorite plugins and let you set up some constants in _wp-config.php_ useful in hardening the WP installation. At the moment is not yet well documented and absent from wordpress.org repository, but we are moving fast, so keep follow!
_______________

* [Wordmove](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove): a great gem (from yours truly) to automatically mirror local WordPress installations and DB data back and forth from your local development machine to the remote staging server;
_______________

* [Wordless-gem](https://github.com/welaika/wordless_gem): the CLI sheriff for your Wordless theme! ~~Compile and clean assets~~, create new WP installation, ~~a new wordless theme~~ and let you set up a deploy command in order to easily deploy your site, collaborating with [Wordmove](https://github.com/welaika/wordmove), with a `wordless deploy` (*warning:* with the advent of Wordless 2.x some wordless-gem's functions are no more useful. We are in the process to imagine its future deveopment path)

## Known problems and limitations
* Wordless has not been tested on Windows machines
* The routing part can be drammaticaly improved to make it more readable and DRY
* This is go-ahead software, everything is subject to change :) but you can pull code from *tagged commits* (stable)

## Inline code documentation

You can find it [here](http://welaika.github.io/wordless/docs.html). If you are intrested in contribuing to the documentation:

* we are documenting the following at the moment (path recursive)

```
wordless/helpers/*
wordless/helpers/placeholder_images/*
wordless/helpers/templates/*
vendor/mobile_detect.php
```

* here is a [list](http://welaika.github.io/wordless/docs/0.3/dd/da0/todo.html) of documentation holes :9
* go and add doc following the [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/) guides
* pull-request your commits
* we'll recompile the doxygen doc
* the community will be grateful!

## Localization

Wordless is available in English, German, Greek, Italian and Spanish, at the moment.

The user interface was translated by Wasilis Mandratzis-Walz (German and Greek), David Mejorado (Spanish).

Your help is welcome! Add your own language using [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wordless/).
